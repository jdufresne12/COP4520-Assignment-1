# COP4520-Assignment-1
Using 8 threads to quickly and efficiently find all the primes and the sum of all primes up to 100 million.

## How to run
```command
g++ assignment1.cpp -o assignment1 -std=c++20
./assignment1
```
- Since I submitted the executable file for my C++ source code you don't need to run the first command, however, I thought i'd inlcude it anyway. The second command runs executeable file.
